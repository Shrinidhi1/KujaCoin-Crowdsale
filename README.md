## Overview

1. We created KujaCoin, an ERC-20 compliant fungible token, and implemented an automated crowdsale for tokens using Solidity smart contracts. 
2. We used Hardhat as the development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying the smart contracts, and deployed the project on a Ganache personal blockchain integrated with the Hardhat environment. 
3. The Ganache blockchain was also integrated with Remix via MetaMask. 
4. Deploying the project on a local blockchain allowed us to test and debug the smart contracts before deploying them on the main Ethereum network. 
5. Overall, the use of Solidity smart contracts, Hardhat, and a local blockchain allowed us to create, test, and deploy a functional cryptocurrency project with minimal risk or cost.

## Requirements

This project leverages python version 3.7.11 with the following packages and modules:

- Solidity - Create the smart contract and implement the joints saving application to work with ether.

- Remix IDE - Write and edit solidity code to create the contracts

- MetaMask - Use digital wallet and a gateway for the Ethereum blockchain.

- OpenZeppelin - OpenZeppelin library provides a wide variety of contracts that are related to the ERC-20 token standard.
